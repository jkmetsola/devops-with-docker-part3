Very simple implementation to run containerized robot framework test script.
Using launch.json and tasks.json, one is able to set entry point for docker container 
and run application.

However, I don't see this way of executing that beneficial because most of the debug features 
cannot be used with containerization (for example break pointing). This way of executing
would be really nice but because I couldn't find any info how to stop at breakpoint
when using docker container, I don't see value doing docker containerization 
when debugging with VSCode.
